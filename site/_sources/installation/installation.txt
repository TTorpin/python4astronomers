Python Installation and Understanding Packages
==============================================

Installing the Python language itself on most platforms is generally very easy.
However, the basic mechanics behind
package management can be confusing at first sight.

Workshop goals:

- Install Python and all packages needed for the rest of the workshops
- Understand the concept of Python modules and packages
- Learn how to find and install other 3rd party packages:
  
  - PyPI
  - using pip install
  - using python setup.py install

- Know where Python files live
- Learn how to solve installation problems
- Understand the issues involved with multiple Python installations
